"""Compute the wind pack, data/dock-v1-wind/, and data/wind/references.jsonl: v3's qualified marine weeks, each
transplanted into weather weeks of data/wind/weather.jsonl by agentenv_portsim.wind.transplant and played live through
agentenv_portsim.wind.WindWeek, as scripts/marine_references.py does for portsim-marine.

Three rolling CP-SAT re-planners solve the week at every watch with live_references.solve under forecast relief and
marine_references' pilot and tug pools for the ships still open: the follower on the week as known, the blind one with
the wind taken out of it, and the hold-every-warning one on every window any delivered forecast showed. The hindsight
optimum is solved on the wind that blew, to a proven optimum; the task's reference cost is the anchor, the lower of
that optimum and the follower's best net cost. A pair qualifies when (a) the follower reaches the hindsight optimum in
at least 3 of its 4 solver configurations, (b) the blind re-planner (in a bust week the hold-every-warning one) scores
at most 0.9 in at least 3 of 4, (c) the week has at most 9 watches and (d) no ship alongside at hour 0 leaves inside a
window above 30 kn.

screen plays every pair, deal picks the pairs, pack writes the pack from the screen and the deal, and references replays
the packed pairs' stored plans without solving and writes their records.
