"""Compute the marine pack, data/dock-v1-marine/, and data/marine/references.jsonl: the one-week dock-v1-eval weeks with
the port's pilots and tugs, each played live through agentenv_portsim.marine by the rolling CP-SAT re-planner and the
naive online policy, as scripts/live_references.py does for portsim-live.

The other traffic comes from the port's 2024 calls of every ship type (RAW, CC BY-SA 4.0), downloaded once at a pinned
commit and checked by its sha256. Each week's tug outage and pilot shortage start 24 hours after the bulletin whose
window holds the most of that pool's demand in the week's dock-v1-eval optimum, so they arrive on that bulletin. The
hindsight optimum is solved with everything known, to a proven optimum. The re-planner lets the pools cover the frozen
windows' own demand, since the grade excuses what news does to them. Both use live_references.solve, berth_core.solve's
optimal_plan model (Apache-2.0), with one cumulative constraint per pool.
